I am like a bird!
I only fly away! 
I don't know where my soul is 
I don't know how it cold is

I said bird bird bird
bird is the word
I said bird bird bird
bird is the word
because bird is a word

therefore 
bird bird bird 
bird is a word

But how how how
how is the cow 
yes 
how how how
how is the cow
